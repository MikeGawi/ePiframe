# ePiframe

Python 3 e-Paper (or any other HDMI/Composite display) Raspberry Pi Photo Frame with Google Photos and/or local storage (and more), weather information, Telegram Bot, Web User Interface, API and plugins.

## Main features

* Pull photos (supports all formats including RAW, videos are ignored) from one or more albums in Google Photos (shared between users who can modify the content) and/or from local folder and automatically prepares them for attached display (automatic conversion to black-and-white or multicolor e-Paper with 6 different presets, color inversion, limited palette, etc. and various background colors)
* Non-HDMI e-Paper Waveshare/Pimoroni (black-and-white or multicolor) and SPI or any other HDMI, Composite displays supported
* With e-Paper display photovg is shown even if power (or network) is down as e-Paper takes power only during refresh and doesn't have backlight - so no blank frames
* Works with Desktop or CLI (console) OS versions and even for Raspberry Pi Zero W (wireless) and offline Raspberry Pi Zero (when using local source) + Raspberry Pi OS Lite
* Autonomic device, once configured can be left headless with system service supervising whole process that is auto recovering and auto starting by itself
* Simple activation for Google Photos access from ePiframe device (with guide) or any other device with Python
* No additional storage for Google Photos source or 3rd party software is required as only one and current photo is downloaded and processed per frame update
* When using local source it is possible to sync photos from almost all cloud/image hosting providers using 3rd party software
* Updating after time interval with option to change time per photo (by *hot word* in photo description)
* Configurable off hours (and HDMI display power control) per different days
* Photo filtering (by creation date, number of images), showing randomly, descendingly or ascendingly
* For vertical or horizontal frame position
* Can be controlled from Telegram Bot, embedded WebUI or API and can display weather information
* Can improve displayed photos on the fly (with powerful [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) on board), i.e. normalization, contrast and brightness settings, gamma correction, etc.
* Extensible, customizable and open for 3rd party add-ons with [ePiframe plugins](#plugins)

## Hardware required

<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org"><img width="100" align="right" src="https://github.com/MikeGawi/ePiframe/blob/master/docs/assets/RPi-Logo.png"></a>

* A Raspberry Pi with standard GPIO 40 pins (for e-Paper HAT). Models Zero (offline - when using local source), Zero W and Zero WH supported
* [microSD card for Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#sd-cards), 4GB minimum
* [e-Paper Waveshare SPI display](https://www.waveshare.com/product/raspberry-pi/displays/e-paper.htm), [e-ink Pimoroni Inky display](https://shop.pimoroni.com/search?q=inky&product_type=Raspberry%20Pi%20Addon) or any other HDMI, Composite display
* Raspberry Pi power supply (for e-Paper display 5V/3A is preferred as it is usually powered from RasPi HAT)
* Photo frame

### Frame

You can use any photo frame for your ePiframe and cut the back to make place for the display connector and glue Raspberry Pi onto it. Also, a good passe-partout piece should frame your display and cover all unwanted elements. 

Or you can 3D print a nice standing frame back with case for your Raspberry Pi and even passe-partout and assemble it with bought photo frame like I did here:

<div align="center">

|<img src="https://github.com/MikeGawi/ePiframe/blob/master/docs/assets/frame1.jpg" width="500"/>| 
|:--:| 
|*Printed back (black) of 13x18cm (5"x7") frame for 7.5" screen with passe-partout (white)*|

</div>

[Thing files](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4727060)

ePiframe is a very nice handmade gift idea: create an album that whole family can edit, decorate frame (e.g. [decoupage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoupage)) or print it, print family signatures or baby drawings on the back, put some wishes picture on the e-Paper display before handing it and many more. 

## Installation

Installation, configuration and API documentation can be found <font size="+2"><b>[HERE](https://github.com/MikeGawi/ePiframe/blob/master/INSTALL.md)</b></font>

### Plugins

ePiframe supports custom plugins that can be created by anyone and can enhance *ALL* ePiframe functions (or even more). Check [ePiframe_plugin](https://github.com/MikeGawi/ePiframe_plugin) for more information, documentation, examples, tutorial and available plugins list.
